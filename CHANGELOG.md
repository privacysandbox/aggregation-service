    [v0.39.0](https://github.com/privacysandbox/control-plane-shared-libraries/tree/v0.39.0), which
    requires 6 Elastic IP addresses for the subnets of the created VPC. With the default
    [AWS VPC EIPs quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html)
    set to 5 per region, users may need to request for more quota when deploying the Aggregate
    Service or decrease the number of subnets created for the aggregation service VPC. To stay
    within the default quota you can decrease the number of subnets, by setting
    `vpc_availability_zones = ["a","b","c","d","e"]` in your `<name>.auto.tfvars`

-   Addressed both

    suggest reading the [debugging](./DEBUGGING.md) document for debug aggregation runs.

    you design your systems with the `no-duplicate` rule in consideration.
