# Building aggregation service artifacts for Amazon Web Services

## Prerequisites

### Set up AWS client

Make sure you
[install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and
[set up](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) the latest
AWS client.

### Set up Terraform

Change into the `<repository_root>/build-scripts/aws/terraform` folder.

The setup scripts require terraform version `1.2.3`. You can download Terraform version `1.2.3` from
[https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.2.3/](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.2.3/)
or _at your own risk_, you can install and use
[Terraform version manager](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) instead.

If you have the Terraform version manager `tfenv` installed, run the following in your
`<repository_root>/build-scripts/aws/terraform` to set Terraform to version `1.2.3`.

```sh
tfenv install 1.2.3;
tfenv use 1.2.3
```

We recommend you store the [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state) in a cloud
bucket. Create a S3 bucket via the console/cli, which we'll reference as `tf_state_bucket_name`.
Please consider enabling versioning for this bucket.

## Configure CodeBuild Setup

Copy `main.tf_sample` and `codebuild.auto.tfvars_sample` and adjust values. Run in
`<repository_root>/build-scripts/aws/terraform`

```sh
cp main.tf_sample main.tf
cp codebuild.auto.tfvars_sample codebuild.auto.tfvars
```

Open `main.tf` to configure your terraform state backend storage. Open `codebuild.auto.tfvars` to
set build region, artifact_output location and github access credentials. All available variables to
configure can be found in codebuild_variables.tf

Run `terrform init` to setup terraform.

To apply changes run `terraform apply` and follow the prompt

```terraform
Plan: 8 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
...
```

## Building the build container

The build container is requried for the aggregation service artifacts build.

To trigger the build run:

```sh
aws codebuild start-build --project-name bazel-build-container --region <your_aws_region>
```

The build can take several minutes. You can check the status at
`https://<region>.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects`.

## Building artifacts

To build the aggregation service artifacts the above build container is required. Make sure the
build for the build container ran successful before starting the build for the aggregation service
artifacts.

To trigger the build run:

```sh
aws codebuild start-build --project-name aggregation-service-artifacts-build --region <your_aws_region>
```

The build can take several minutes. You can check the status at
`https://<region>.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codebuild/projects`.

## Download artifacts

To download the artifacts you can use the `aws s3` command. Download the artifacts to
`<repository_root>/terraform/aws/jars`. Run the following in `<repository_root>/terraform/aws`

```sh
mkdir -p jars
aws s3 cp s3://<build_artifacts_output_bucket>/aggregation-service/$(cat ../../VERSION)/ jars/ --recursive
```

### Fetch Aggregation Service Terraform

Switch to `<repository_root>/terraform/aws`.

Run `bash fetch_terraform.sh`.

After downloading the artifacts and running above script continue with
[Set up your deployment environment](/docs/aws-aggregation-service.md#set-up-your-deployment-environment)

## Upgrade Terraform AWS provider to `5.x` version

1. Update the Terraform code to the most recent version in the repository.
2. Remove Terraform variable `compute_type` in `codebuild.auto.tfvars`.
3. Update aws provider version in `main.tf` to the latest `5.x`.

    ```hcl
    required_providers {
        aws = {
            source  = "hashicorp/aws"
            version = "~> 5.0"
        }
    }
    ```

4. Update the locked dependency selections and apply changes.

    ```shell
    terraform init -upgrade
    terraform apply
    ```

5. (Optional) Update the Terraform variables `aggregation_service_compute_type` and
   `bazel_compute_type` to change the compute type for the bazel or aggregation-service CodeBuild,
   if necessary.

## Terraform variable changes (AWS provider version `3.x`)

1. Update the Terraform code to the most recent version in the repository.
2. Remove Terraform variable `compute_type` in `codebuild.auto.tfvars`.
3. Set the Terraform variable `aggregation_service_compute_type` to `BUILD_GENERAL1_2XLARGE` in
   `codebuild.auto.tfvars`.
