# Job Request Validations

These are the validations that are done before the aggregation begins.

1. **Job request is valid**\
   i. Job request is not empty.\
   ii. Job should have a job_request_id.

2. **Job parameters are valid**\
   All required `request_info.job_parameters` map entries must be set with valid values. \
   Please see the createJob request parameter documentation above for more details.
3. Job request's `job_parameters.attribution_report_to` value should match Aggregatable Report's
   `shared_info.reporting_origin`. Reports that fail this validation are counted in
   ATTRIBUTION_REPORT_TO_MISMATCH error counter. Aggregatable report validations and error counters
   can be found in the
   [Input Aggregatable Report Validations](#input-aggregatable-report-validations) below

Return code:
[INVALID_JOB](java/com/google/aggregate/adtech/worker/AggregationWorkerReturnCode.java#L38)

  "request_processing_started_at": <timestamp>
}
```

#### Error Response codes

In case of errors in successfully completing the job, the below error response codes would be
present in the `result_info` section of the GetJob API response body

-   RETRIES_EXHAUSTED: The aggregation request failed because it exhausted the number of retries
    attempted. This error is transient and the job can be retried.

If the job fails due to a handled exception, then `result_info.return_code` will have the
corresponding error code in
[AggregationWorkerReturnCode.java](../java/com/google/aggregate/adtech/worker/AggregationWorkerReturnCode.java)
and `result_info.return_messages` will have the exception message followed by a few stack frames of
the exception stacktrace for debugging.

If an unexpected exception occurs, `result_info.error_summary.error_messages` will contain the error
messages.

#### Error Counts - error_counts

The count of reports that are excluded from aggregation due to errors can be found in the getJob
response `result_info.error_summary.error_counts` with the `category` field giving the error code
and `count` giving the number of reports in that category.

[Error categories and description](../java/com/google/aggregate/adtech/worker/model/ErrorCounter.java)

If the total number of reports with errors exceeds 10% of the total report count, then the job will
fail early with return code
[REPORTS_WITH_ERRORS_EXCEEDED_THRESHOLD](../java/com/google/aggregate/adtech/worker/AggregationWorkerReturnCode.java#L88)
before the privacy budget is consumed. The threshold percentage can be set in
job.request_info.job_parameters for the key "report_error_threshold_percentage".

#### Error Response body

These match the [Google Cloud Error Model](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors#error_model)

```jsonc
{
    "error": {
        "code": 3,
        // Corresponds to this
        "message": "detailed error message string",
        "status": "INVALID_ARGUMENT",
        "details": [
            {
                "reason": "API_KEY_INVALID",
                "domain": "foo.com",
                // might not be present
                "metadata": {
                    // Map<String, String>, might not be present
                    "service": "translate.googleapis.com"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Appendix

#### Input File format

Aggregation service expects input aggregatable reports batched in the
[Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) format given below. Please see
[Collecting and Batching Aggregatable Reports](/docs/collecting.md) for how to generate avro
aggregatable reports using collected data.

#### [reports.avsc](/protocol/avro/reports.avsc)

```avro
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "AggregatableReport",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "payload",
      "type": "bytes"
    },
    {
      "name": "key_id",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "name": "shared_info",
      "type": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

Additionally a domain file is needed to declare all expected aggregation keys for aggregating the
aggregatable reports (keys not listed in the domain file won't be aggregated)

#### [output_domain.avsc](/protocol/avro/output_domain.avsc)

```avro
{
 "type": "record",
 "name": "AggregationBucket",
 "fields": [
   {
     "name": "bucket",
     "type": "bytes"
     /* A single bucket that appears in
     the aggregation service output.
     128-bit integer encoded as a
     16-byte big-endian byte string. */
   }
 ]
}
```

#### Output File format

Summary report is the output file generated by the Aggregation Service and is also in avro format
with the following schema -

#### [results.avsc](/protocol/avro/results.avsc)

```avro
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "AggregatedFact",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "bucket",
      "type": "bytes",
      "doc": "Histogram bucket used in aggregation. 128-bit integer encoded as a 16-byte big-endian bytestring. Leading 0-bits will be left out."
    },
    {
      "name": "metric",
      "type": "long",
      "doc": "Metric associated with the bucket"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Input Aggregatable Report Validations

Input aggregatable report is required to have a valid and/or supported value for the following
report shared_info fields: `api`, `report_id`, `reporting_origin` and `scheduled_report_time`.
Invalid aggregatable reports will not be included in the aggregation. getJob response
`result_info.error_summary.error_counts` will have error counters for these invalid reports along
with the error code, reason and count of reports in each category.

If the invalid reports in a job exceed the `report_error_threshold_percentage` (see the
[createJob](#createjob-endpoint) request job parameters above), the job will fail with
REPORTS_WITH_ERRORS_EXCEEDED_THRESHOLD error.

Invalid aggregatable report error counters corresponding to various validations -

| shared_info field     | ErrorCode                       | Error Reason                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| api                   | UNSUPPORTED_REPORT_API_TYPE     | api is unsupported                             |
| report_id             | INVALID_REPORT_ID               | report_id is empty                             |
| reporting_origin      | ATTRIBUTION_REPORT_TO_MALFORMED | syntactically invalid domain                   |
| scheduled_report_time | ORIGINAL_REPORT_TIME_TOO_OLD    | older than 90 days at the time of aggregation. |
| version               | UNSUPPORTED_SHAREDINFO_VERSION  | unsupported report shared_info.version         |

If report `shared_info.version` is higher than supported major version, the aggregation job will
fail without consuming privacy budget with `result_info.return_code` UNSUPPORTED_REPORT_VERSION.
