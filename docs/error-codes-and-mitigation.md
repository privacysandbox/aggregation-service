# Error Codes and Mitigations for Aggregation Service

## Aggregation Service Return Codes and Mitigations

This section covers the return code provided by the Aggregation Service job once it finishes
running. The `return_code` field within the `result_info` section of the getJob API response will
provide these return codes listed in [/docs/api.md#getjob-endpoint](/docs/api.md#getjob-endpoint).

from aggregation due to errors and can be found in the `getJob` response
`result_info.error_summary.error_counts`. See
[/docs/api.md#error-response-body-1](/docs/api.md#error-response-body-1) for more details.

Check that the trigger has been registered with the correct cloud using the `aggregation_coordinator_origin` field (instructions here: [AGGREGATE.md#data-processing-through-a-secure-aggregation-service in github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api](https://github.com/WICG/attribution-reporting-api/blob/main/AGGREGATE.md#data-processing-through-a-secure-aggregation-service)). This can also happen when aggregatable reports encrypted for one cloud are aggregated with an Aggregation service running on another cloud provider. Validate the public key endpoint used to encrypt the aggregatable reports. On your raw aggregatable report received in your .well-known reporting endpoint, you should be able to see the `aggregation_coordinator_origin` field. For GCP, the value should be `https://publickeyservice.msmt.gcp.privacysandboxservices.com`. For AWS, it's `https://publickeyservice.msmt.aws.privacysandboxservices.com`. If `aggregation_coordinator_origin` is not stated in the Attribution Reporting API / Private Aggregation API, the default will be AWS. For Attribution Reporting API, you can specify your cloud provider by passing it in the trigger registration. For Private Aggregation API, you will have to define the `aggregationCoordinatorOrigin` using the example in Aggregation coordinator choice section in the Private Aggregation API explainer. Please specify `https://publickeyservice.msmt.gcp.privacysandboxservices.com` as the "aggregationCoordinatorOrigin". |
